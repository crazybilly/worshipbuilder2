## Communion

For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you:<br><br>
The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."<br><br>
In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."<br><br>
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
